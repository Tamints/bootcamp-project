# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

DSA project template for the Bootcamp on Nov 1st, 2025. 

Provide a [link to your dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/data) 

Briefly _explain_ your **hypothesis**.
We are trying to make a prediction of Cardiovascular disease based on multiple factors ranging from lab tests to lifestyle habits. We will try to narrow down those factors to the ones that give the best prediction, and calculate the accuracy of our model.
